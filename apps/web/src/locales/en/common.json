    "history": "History",
    "historyText": "Borșa is a town with a rich history, first documented in 1365 when King Louis I granted it to Balc and his brother. In 1717, local fighters led by Popa Lupu Șandor repelled the Tatar invasion in the battle at \"Preluca Tătarilor\". The town officially became a commune and parish in 1774. Throughout centuries, Borșa was an important mining center, with a tradition in ore exploitation that deeply shaped the identity of the local community.",
    "geography": "Geography",
    "geographyText": "Situated at an altitude of approximately 700m, at the eastern edge of Maramureș County, Borșa lies at the base of the Rodna Massif near Prislop Pass. The town serves as a gateway between the Maramureș Depression and the Bistrița Aurie valley. The Rodna Mountains — the highest mountain range in northern Romania, with Pietrosul Peak at 2,303m — provide a spectacular natural backdrop. The Rodna Mountains National Park, a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve, protects remarkable biodiversity.",
    "nature": "Nature & Tourism",
    "natureText": "Borșa is a year-round destination. In winter, three ski slopes — Olympic, Cascada Cailor, and Prislop — attract thousands of skiers, alongside activities like snowmobiling and sledding. In summer, hikers and nature lovers explore mountain trails to Horses Waterfall (Romania's tallest waterfall, ~95m), glacial lakes Iezer and Știol, or Pietrosul Rodnei peak. The area also offers ATV riding, horseback riding, mountain biking, and rafting. The resort hosts 5,000-7,000 skiers during winter season.",
    "traditions": "Traditions & Culture",
    "traditionsText": "Maramureș is world-renowned for its authentic traditions, and Borșa preserves them with pride. The Maramureș folk costume, with embroidered blouses and traditional footwear, is still worn at celebrations. Wooden churches, UNESCO monuments, represent masterpieces of traditional architecture. Local crafts — wood carving, weaving, wool processing — continue to be practiced. The Snow Festival, an annual event in February, celebrates winter with ski competitions, folk music, and traditional gastronomy. Maramureș carved wooden gates are a symbol of local hospitality.",
    "landmarks": "Spiritual Landmarks",
    "landmarksText": "The Borșa area is rich in places of worship with historical and spiritual value. Moisei Monastery, founded in 1599, is one of the oldest monastic settlements in the region. The Wooden Church of \"Holy Archangels Michael and Gabriel\", built in 1700 and reconstructed after the Tatar invasion of 1717, is a historical monument with impressive interior paintings. Pietroasa Hermitage, situated at 1,000m altitude, offers a spiritual retreat in a spectacular natural setting. The Heroes Monument at Moisei commemorates the 29 victims of the 1944 massacre.",
